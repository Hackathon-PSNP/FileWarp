# FileWarp

FileWarp is a bare bones app created to get a working interface of [react-native-wifi-p2p](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-wifi-p2p).
 
FileWarp is mainly based on the sample provided [here](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-wifi-p2p#example-of-usage).

I'm grateful towards [Kirill Zyusko](https://github.com/kirillzyusko) for helping me deal with the issues.

This app is built on react-native and works only on Android devices.

There might be some extra dependencies, which I hope to remove someday.

More updates to README will follow in the future.

For more information regarding the nature of buttons refer [here](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-wifi-p2p#api).
